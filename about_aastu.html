		<h1>Addis Ababa Science and Technology University(AASTU)</h1>
		<p>
			Addis Ababa Science and Technology University (Amharic: አዲስ አበባ ሳይንስና ቴክኖሎጂ ዩኒቨርስቲ), or AASTU, is an
			Ethiopian higher institute in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The main campus is located in the Akaky Kaliti
			subcity, Kilinto area.
		</p>
		<p>
			The concept of Addis Ababa Science and Technology University had a direct and reasonable connection
			with the Five-Year Growth and Transformation Plan (2010-2015) of the government of the Federal
			Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. As it was stated in the
			plan, the establishment of well institutionalized and strong science and technology universities and
			institutes of technology will serve as a cornerstone to build an economically developed and
			industrialized state of Ethiopia. As a
			result, AASTU was founded in 2011 under the Directive of the Council of Ministers No. 216/2011 by
			admitting the first batch (2000 students) in November 2011.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, the university has enrolled more than 8000 undergraduate (under regular and continuing
			education program) and close to 700 postgraduate students under its nine applied sciences,
			technology, engineering and ICT focused schools. AASTU is a university
			in the making, and much of its short-term plans aim at establishing academic infrastructures and
			facilities, staff recruitment and manpower development. So far, we managed to recruit 472 academic
			staff and 391 administrative staff.
