		<h1>Time Management Tips</h1>
		<h2>Todo Lists</h2>
		<p> To Do Lists are one of the most effective ways to stay on track. Record all the things you need to
			accomplish then focus on completing one task at a time. Don't forget
			to reward yourself for a job well done once tasks have been successfully completed! </p>
		<h2>Prioritize Tasks</h2>
		<p> Prioritize Tasks on your To Do List to ensure the most critical and time-sensitive ones are completed
			first. </p>
		<h2>Eliminate Distractions</h2>
		<p> Eliminate Distractions so your attention is devoted to the task at hand. You'll finish tasks and move
			on to the next ones
			more quickly while paying more attention to details. So clean off your desktop, close unneeded windows
			on your computer, put your phone on silent, and turn off the TV! </p>
		<h2>Develop Anti-Procrastnation Plan</h2>
		<p> Develop an Anti-Procrastination Plan that stops you from putting off until tomorrow what you can
			accomplish today. Create a calendar with all your deadlines and due dates
			so you can see the big picture. Then create your daily To Do List from this. Break down large, daunting
			tasks into smaller ones that can quickly be achieved â€“ before you know it,
			the larger task will be done! </p>
		<h2>Set Study Schedule</h2>
		<p> Set a Schedule, and stick to it. Set aside time each day for your studies and let your friends,
			family, and colleagues know when this is, so it goes uninterrupted. Hang
			a Do Not Disturb sign on your door. Allow enough time by following the general rule of thumb of 2 hours
			of
			study time for every one credit hour of class (e.g. if you are in a 3
			credit course, then plan 6 hours of study time each week for the course. More or less study time may be
			needed depending on your familiarity with the subject matter and your own
			unique learning style). </p>
		<h2>Time Wasters</h2>
		<p> It is vital to be aware of time wasters or they will consume your valuable time. Surfing
			the internet, watching TV, gaming, and browsing social media sites are
			all notorious time wasters. Use these as rewards once your To Do List has been completed. Keep your To
			Do List close by to help you stay focused and on task. </p>
		<h2>Organization</h2>
		<p> a Great Time Saver! Create a filing system, with clear, logical categories, allows you
			to quickly find a needed document. Keep your study area clutter-free by
			immediately filing unneeded items away. The less time you spend hunting something down, the more time
			youhave for completing important tasks! </p>
		<h2>Use your Downtime wisely</h2>
		<p> Use Downtime to Your Advantage by always having something on hand to do. Access your eBook and read a
			chapter during your lunch break, study your notes while waiting at the
			doctor's office, or review your To Do List from your mobile device while cooking dinner. </p>
		<h2>Find your Productive Time</h2>
		<p> Find your 'Productive Time Zone' by identifying the time of day you feel your best. Take advantage of
			this energy and schedule your "class time" as close to it as possible.
			Be sure to keep your productivity levels up by taking regularly scheduled breaks. </p>
		<h2>Create a Time Budget</h2>
		<p> Create a Time Budget by determining how much time you spend on activities, whether they are for your
			job,
			family commitments, household chores, or school work. Determining
			the amount of time you spend in these areas will ensure enough time is allocated for these items and, in
			turn, help you decide if free time is available for any additional commitments. </p>
